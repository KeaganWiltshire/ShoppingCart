            <h4> The purpose of this project</h4>
            <span>
                This project was first proposed by Rothman to help schools keep track of records at sports days.<br>
                Due to the complexity of having to gather a multitude of records from a vast amount of score keepers whose
                handwriting might not always be legible, we have created a web-based application to help ease the burden
                of collection and allow one to more easily compare current records with a student's previous records.
